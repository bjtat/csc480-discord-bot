git add

How to use:
git add <path>      : Stage a specific directory or file.
git add .           : Stage all files (that are not listed in the .gitignore) in the entire repository.
git add -p          : Interactively stage hunks of changes.

Guide:
The "git add" command adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area. "git add [filename]" selects that file, and moves it to the staging area, marking it for inclusion in the next commit. You can select all files, a directory, specific files, or even specific parts of a file for staging and commit.

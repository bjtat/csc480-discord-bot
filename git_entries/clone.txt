git clone

How to use:
git clone [url]     : Clone (download) a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits.
git clone --mirror  : Clone a repository but without the ability to edit any of the files.

Guide:
"git clone" command is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository. When you clone a repository, you don't get one file, like you may in other centralized version control systems. By cloning with Git, you get the entire repository - all files, all branches, and all commits.

git config

How to use:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"   : Declare your name for all repositories.
git config --global user.email mail@ex.com  : Declare your email for all repositories.

Guide:
You need to set who you are *before* creating any commit. That will allow commits to have the right author name and email associated to them.

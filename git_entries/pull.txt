git pull

How to use:
git pull            : Update your local working branch with commits from the remote, and update all remote tracking branches.
git pull --rebase   : Update your local working branch with commits from the remote, but rewrite history so any local commits occur after all new commits coming from the remote, avoiding a merge commit.
git pull --all      : Fetch all remotes

Guide:
"git pull" updates your current local working branch, and all of the remote tracking branches. It's a good idea to run git pull regularly on the branches you are working on locally.
Without "git pull", (or the effect of it,) your local branch wouldn't have any of the updates that are present on the remote.

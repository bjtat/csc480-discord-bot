git push

How to use:
git push        : Uploads all local branch commits to the corresponding remote branch.
git push -f     : Force a push that would otherwise be blocked, usually because it will delete or overwrite existing commits (Use with caution!)
git push --all  : Push all branches
git push --tags : Publish tags that aren't yet in the remote repository

Guide:
"git push" updates the remote branch with local commits. You can also think of "git push" as update or publish.

git status

How to use:
git status      : Shows the current state of your Git working directory and staging area.
git status -s   : Give output in short format
git status -v   : Shows more "verbose" detail including the textual changes of any uncommitted files

Guide:
When in doubt, run "git status". This is always a good idea. The "git status" command only outputs information of the current state, it won't modify commits or changes in your local repository.
